# Char-RNN with TensorFlow

This is from the RNN lesson from the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. 

We'll build a character-wise RNN trained on Anna Karenina. It'll be able to generate new text based on the text from the book. This network is based off of Andrej Karpathy's [post on RNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and [implementation in Torch](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn); also, some information [here at r2rt](http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii.html) and from [Sherjil Ozair](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) on GitHub. 

Below is the general architecture of the character-wise RNN.
